## Safe Languages in Blockchain

"More blockchain protocols are expected to adopt memory-safe languages like Rust. Some have their own custom languages. Learning to code is essential."

- Rust offers safety and performance in blockchain development  
- Programming is a fundamental skill for working in Web3 and blockchain security
