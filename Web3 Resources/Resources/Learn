## Start Learning With

📘 Mastering Ethereum by Andreas Antonopoulos and Dr. Gavin Woods  
Chapters to focus on: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, and 14

GitHub repository:  
https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook

If you’re not a book person, there are also video resources ahead that explain the same concepts, though not as in-depth like the book.

## Learn Solidity Programming Language.

Before diving into CTFs or audits, make sure you’re comfortable with the language.

## Safe Languages in Blockchain

"More blockchain protocols are expected to adopt memory-safe languages like Rust. Some have their own custom languages. Learning to code is essential."

- Rust offers safety and performance in blockchain development  
- Programming is a fundamental skill for working in Web3 and blockchain security

web3 bug bounty platform  >> They Called it "audit contest" NOT " A bug bounty "
 
 - code4rena.com 
 - immunefi.com  

a contest will run between 3 to 7 days 

by the end of the week period the full prize is guranteed to be paid out to all the participantes who 
submitting findings during that order contest 

( it means you get payout if your submisson is a duplicate )
