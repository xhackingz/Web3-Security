Start Learning WIth :
--------------------

- Mastering Ethereum by Andreas Antonopoulos and Dr. Gavin Woods.
You’ll want to read chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, and 14. If you’re not a book person, 
then there are video resources ahead that explain the same concepts, although not as in-depth as the book will.

Your next step is going to be learning the ins-and-outs of Solidity, or whatever language your smart contracts of choice are written in. 
If you aren’t familiar with the code and its common implementations, then you’ll lag behind, wasting time trying to Google unfamiliar functions or libraries.
Several auditors more experienced than me have told me this before. At the beginning of my journey, 
I didn’t listen and tried my hand at a few Ethereum smart contract CTFs. Needless to say, the code looked like gibberish. 
So, I headed back to the proverbial Ethereum school and familiarized myself with the language. I used this course offered completely for free by freeCodeCamp.

Tip: You might not be able to pick up the syntax of Solidity easily from this course, so I recommend checking out CryptoZombies for additional practice. 
It’ll take much less time to get acquainted with the syntax.

Note: It is not necessary to be able to code a UI or frontend with JavaScript, React, etc. to be a smart contract auditor/hacker. 
It’s more necessary if you’re trying to be a full-fledged blockchain developer.
