## üèõÔ∏è Centralization vs Decentralization

| Concept            | Centralization                          | Decentralization                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Controlled by a single entity            | Control is distributed among many users   |
| **Example**        | Banks, Governments                       | Bitcoin, Ethereum                         |
| **Trust**          | Trust in the authority                   | Trust in the system (code, consensus)     |
| **Weak Point**     | Single point of failure                  | More resilient to attacks or censorship   |
