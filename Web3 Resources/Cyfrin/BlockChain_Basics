## 🪙 What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without banks.  
It was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and introduced the concept of blockchain — a distributed ledger.

## ⚙️ Ethereum and Smart Contracts

In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum — a blockchain like Bitcoin but with added features like smart contracts.  
Launched in 2015, Ethereum enabled decentralized applications and agreements.

They took what made Bitcoin great and added programmable contracts.

## 🧠 Origin of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts were first introduced by Nick Szabo in the 1990s as self-executing agreements written in code.  
Ethereum brought this idea to life on the blockchain.

## 🏛️ Centralization vs Decentralization

| Concept    | Centralization                | Decentralization               |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Control    | Single authority (like banks) | Shared among many participants |
| Example    | Governments, banks            | Bitcoin, Ethereum              |
| Trust      | Based on authority            | Based on code and consensus    |
| Weak Point | Single point of failure       | More resilient                 |

## 🔗 The Oracle Problem

Smart contracts can't access real-world data on their own.  
Oracles provide this external data, allowing smart contracts to respond to real-world events.

To stay decentralized, we use decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink:

## 🧱 Layer 2 Scaling

Layer 2 networks help blockchains scale by handling transactions off-chain and settling on-chain.

Types of Layer 2:

- Optimistic Rollups: Optimism, Arbitrum  
- ZK Rollups: ZKsync, Polygon ZK EVM

---

## 📘 Key Terms

- Blockchain: Distributed ledger (like Bitcoin)  
- Smart contract: Code that executes automatically when conditions are met  
- Oracle: Service that provides real-world data to smart contracts  
- Layer 2: Technology that improves blockchain scalability  
- Dapp: Decentralized application  
- Hybrid contract: Combines on-chain logic with off-chain data  
- EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine that runs smart contracts

## 🌐 Web Evolution

- Web1: Read-only, open, static  
- Web2: Centralized, dynamic, user content  
- Web3: Decentralized, permissionless, user-owned

## ✅ Wrap Up

Bitcoin introduced blockchain.  
Ethereum expanded it with smart contracts.  
Smart contracts automate trust, and oracles connect them to the real world.
